#This is my repo for STATS 220.

##**A little about me:**

- I am undertaking a degree in _Commerce_ and _Science_,
  \n
  Majoring in:
  1. Business Analytics
  2. Finance
  3. Statistics
- I am taking STATS 220 because it was a prerequisite for another paper
- I am interested in learning about data technologies
